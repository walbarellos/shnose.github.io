# Coding with APIs

## Interesting Models

- code-davinci-002: Most capable Codex model. Particularly good at translating natural language to code. In addition to completing code, also supports inserting completions within code.
- gpt-3.5-turbo-0301: A set of models that improve on GPT-3 and can understand as well as generate natural language or code


## Possible Applications

- develop indefinitely:
  - "When I say `continue` you will continue to improve the code we were working on and implement new ideas and features with the goal of improving the project to its maximum quality. You should also describe your reasoning."
