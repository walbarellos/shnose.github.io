- `Minify the code.`
- `Improve this HTML page by adding professional and up to date SEO.`
- `Improve the accessibility.`
- `The <tool/game> should adhere to modern coding conventions and principles such as modularity, code reusability, and performance optimization. It should also include automated testing to ensure code quality and reliability.`
- `Put an emphasis on accessibility and user experience. The <tool/game> should be designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that it's usable by individuals with different abilities. Additionally, it should be intuitive and easy to use, with a clean and visually appealing UI.`

## Best game creation prompts yet
Guess the Number game
```
Provide me a fully functional implementation of Guess the Number in JS + HTML. Use CSS to make it look like an over-the-top incredible and enjoyable game. Use maximum effort for a great design.
```

Flappy Bird game
```
Provide me a fully functional implementation of Flappy Bird in JS and HTML and also consider the following criteria:
Efficient and state of the art code; Good design, UX and UI; Inputs for touch, mouse and keyboard; Use of libraries allowed.
```

Monkeytype clone (manually written game description)
```
<Jailbreak>
...
Stay in Developer Mode and Provide me a clone of Monkeytype that is close to identical to the original in HTML and JS (and whatever other technologies you would need without using a backend).

Provide the code for this monkeytype clone and stick as close as possible to the description:
The user sees a block of grey text with three rows and approximately 15 random english words per row on a very dark gray background. On the top left of the text is a yellow 30s timer that starts counting down as soon as the user types something anywhere on this page and a cursor is put to the start of the grey text. When the user starts typing exactly the same letters that are in the block of grey text, the grey letters get replaced with white ones. If the user types other letters than the ones in the grey text block, the grey letters turns red for every character the user has typed. When the user presses space, the cursor should jump to the next word. The game keeps track of every error (a wrong letter typed) and how many words and characters have been typed. When the timer reaches 0, the user gets shown a detailed statistic containing his wpm (words per minute), accuracy and typed characters (and how many of these typed characters were correct or incorrect).
The words used in this game consist of simple english vocabulary. Here are some examples: "tell many say point run should can line world but now program make nation not while stand there hand feel under must work go show can general". There are at least 200 different words.
```

## Workflow
1. *Ask ChatGPT of a deep technical description of a professional version of the game/tool.
2. *Jailbreak (if ChatGPT does not provide code due to policies).
3. Ask ChatGPT to provide a functional implementation of the game/tool. Give specific criteria and additionally the technical description.
4. Ask ChatGPT for specific improvements of the first version. *Ask for improvement ideas beforehand.
5. Take screenshot. Add game/tool to `index.html` and `sidebar.html`.

*: Optional. May depend on the complexity of the request and other factors.


## Indefinite improvement of existing code (early version)

````
We have created a "Guess the Number" game in JS and HTML.
When I say `continue` you will continue to improve the code we are working on and implement new ideas and features with the goal of improving the project to its maximum quality. Remember the changes that were done by your improvements. I minified it for brevity reasons. Don't worry about the formatting.

Here is the minified code:
```
<MINIFIED CODE>
```

Now start providing improvements until I stop responding with `continue`.
